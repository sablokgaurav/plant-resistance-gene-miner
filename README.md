# plant-resistance-gene-miner
I coded this plant resistance gene miner which uses a regular expression plus a web scrap approach and given a resistance gene id, it will return the genbank id.

```python
# to use simply use the id from the plant resistance gene database \
         : http://www.prgdb.org/prgdb/ with the PRGDB, just the number
mineResistanceGenes(141)
'4689222'
